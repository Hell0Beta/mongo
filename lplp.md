Awesome! You’ve got the security report and project structure layout looking sharp. Let’s go step by step and clean this up into a solid final submission. Here’s a polished version of your **Security in NoSQL (MongoDB)** report — ready for documentation or presentation:

---

## 🔐 **Security in NoSQL (MongoDB)**

### 🔹 **1. Introduction to NoSQL**
NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, and **CouchDB** are known for:
- Flexible schemas
- Easy horizontal scaling
- High performance for large and dynamic datasets

Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), NoSQL is optimized for **speed, scalability, and schema flexibility**, making it ideal for modern web applications.

---

### 🔹 **2. Security in NoSQL**
While powerful, many NoSQL databases **don’t enforce strict security by default**. For example, early versions of MongoDB left ports open, exposing sensitive data.

Modern MongoDB has improved with:
- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Transport encryption** using TLS/SSL
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **IP Whitelisting**
- **Audit logging**

---

### 🔹 **3. Common Attack Vectors**
Here are some key threats to MongoDB systems:

| 🔥 Attack Type        | 💥 Description |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Injection Attacks** | Unsanitized input can be used to manipulate queries |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Poor permissions or no password setup |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | Flooding the DB with expensive queries |
| **Data Leakage** | Lack of encryption in transit or at rest |

---

### 🔹 **4. Solutions Proposed in Literature**
Several researchers and MongoDB’s official team have proposed solutions:

- **Santosh et al. (2020)**:
  - Enforce role-based access
  - Use encrypted authentication tokens

- **Chen & Zhao (2021)**:
  - Introduce secure API gateways
  - Use automated vulnerability scanning tools

- **MongoDB Official Docs**:
  - Enable **TLS/SSL encryption**
  - Use **IP whitelisting**
  - Turn on **audit logging**
  - Avoid running with default ports & credentials

---

### 🔹 **5. Open Challenges**
Despite advances, securing NoSQL systems comes with challenges:

- ⚡ Performance tradeoffs: encryption vs speed
- 🌐 No uniform standards across DB platforms
- ☁️ Cloud configurations can be complex and error-prone
- 🔌 Third-party plugins often introduce risk

---

### 🛠️ **Your Proposal**
> Develop lightweight middleware or plug-ins tailored to **small-to-medium dev teams**:
- **Auto-sanitize user input** against injection
- **Monitor suspicious usage patterns**
- **Warn developers of insecure configurations**

This can serve as a security-first bridge for startups and early-stage devs using NoSQL.
